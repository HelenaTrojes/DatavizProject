          <h2>A Deadly Pattern That Persists</h2>
          <p>
            Every year, hundreds of people in the United States are fatally shot
            by police. While the totals fluctuate slightly, the overall number
            remains alarmingly consistent — averaging around 1,000 victims
            annually since 2015.

            The number of lives lost reflects not just the scale of the problem,
            but its unsettling consistency — a reminder that reform remains
            elusive.

            This chart shows fatal police shootings
            <strong>per million residents per year</strong>, grouped by race.
            The height of each bar reflects the risk of being killed by police,
            while the width reflects that group's share of the U.S. population.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Black Americans</strong> are killed at more than
            <strong>twice the rate</strong> of White Americans — despite being a
            much smaller share of the population. Hispanic Americans also face
            elevated risks. These disparities highlight broader questions of
            systemic inequality and policing practices in the U.S.
