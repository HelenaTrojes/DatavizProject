          <h2>A Deadly Pattern That Persists</h2>
          <p>
            Every year, hundreds of people in the United States are fatally shot
            by police. While the totals fluctuate slightly, the overall number
            remains alarmingly consistent — averaging around 1,000 victims
            annually since 2015.

            but its unsettling consistency — a reminder that reform remains
            elusive.

            This chart shows fatal police shootings
            <strong>per million residents per year</strong>, grouped by race.
            The height of each bar reflects the risk of being killed by police,
            while the width reflects that group's share of the U.S. population.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Black Americans</strong> are killed at more than
            <strong>twice the rate</strong> of White Americans — despite being a
            much smaller share of the population. Hispanic Americans also face
            elevated risks. These disparities highlight broader questions of
            systemic inequality and policing practices in the U.S.

            More than half of the people shot and killed by police are between
            20 and 40 years old.

          An overwhelming majority of the victims are male - 95%! This striking
          imbalance raises questions about why young men, in particular, are so
          frequently involved in fatal encounters. It points toward deeper
          social, economic, and cultural factors, including how masculinity,
          risk, policing, and structural disadvantage intersect in high-stakes
          situations.

          <h2>What Were Victims Reported to Be Armed With?</h2>
          <p>
            In many fatal police shootings, the person killed was reported to be
            holding a weapon — most often a firearm. Based on 7,729 cases with
            known weapon data, each of the 77 icons below represents
            approximately 100 individuals, offering a simplified visual snapshot
            of the reported circumstances.

        <p></p>
        <p class="weapons-conclusion">
          The fact that most victims were reported to be holding a firearm
          highlights the very real danger officers may face in these encounters.
          In situations involving visible weapons, decisions are often made in a
          matter of seconds — with little margin for error. But not all cases
          are as clear. As we’ll see next, perceived threat isn’t just about
          what someone holds — it’s also shaped by factors like mental illness,
          behavior, and uncertainty.

          <h2>Mental Illness and Threat Level</h2>
          <p>
            How often are shootings linked to mental illness or reported threat
            level?
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="chart-container"></div>

        <p class="viz4-explanation">
          Although most victims — whether showing signs of mental illness or not
          — were labeled as posing an "attack" threat, the similar proportions
          suggest that mental health status had little influence on how
          threatening individuals were perceived in these fatal encounters. This
          could indicate that officers responded similarly regardless of visible
          mental health conditions, raising questions about how threat
          assessments are made in high-stress situations.
